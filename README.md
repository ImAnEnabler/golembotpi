Controlling a robotic head using raspberry pi controllers and 9-DOF sensor

Working on a summer project with my kid(s)

The plan is to use a Raspberry Pi3 with a Servo Bonnet to control servos attached to a robotic "head" frame.  A Raspberry Pi Zero 
will be used to communicate wirelessly via bluetooth, controlling a 9-DOF sensor.  

At the end of the project, if all goes well, we'll be able to tilt the sensor in various directions, and mimic the movement 
on the robotic head.
